## FilterCalculator

A (somewhat basic) attempt to create a program to calculate Lowpass/Highpass filter resistance & capacitors. Results were posted on a graph to allow for user selection, based on availablity.

## VoltageDropper

Consists of two parts, the initial MATLAB code [VoltageDropper.m](./VoltageDropper.m) and the MATLAB Applet [VoltageDropper.mlapp](./VoltageDropper.mlapp).
