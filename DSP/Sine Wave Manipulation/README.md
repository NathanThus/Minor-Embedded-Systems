# Sine Wave Manipulation

GOAL: Create a sine wave in MATLAB using complex numbers.

How: Using complex number multiplication, to create a sine wave.

## Contents

## Code

`Complex.hpp` & `Complex.cpp` - The complex number code files.
`main.cpp` - Contains the code to actually use the complex numbers, as well as some fileIO for use in MATLAB.
`Graph.m` - Basic MATLAB code for importing the data.
`Output.txt` - The output data from running `Main`
