# Moving Average Filter & Impulse Response

![A graph showing both random data and frequency response. There's a moving average filter, as well as exponential decay.](./Figures.png)

And for some clarity, as the requested decay rate of 0.1 is rather aggressive, the value for the IIR filter was changed to 0.8.
