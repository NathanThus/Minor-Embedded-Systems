# Minor Embedded Systems & Signals

Welcome to my portfolio for the Fontys Minor Embedded Systems & Signals. There isn't much to look at right now, but there ought to be a bit more later.
For this semester, I'll be aiming to improve my overall skills in the embedded field, as well as learning a few things about PCB development.
